# ðŸŽ² Watch Later Roulette

**Drowning in your Watch Later playlist? Spin the wheel and let fate decide!**  

Watch Later Roulette is a simple browser extension that helps you finally start watching your ever-growing Watch Later playlist â€” one random video at a time.

## ðŸš§ Work In Progress

This project is currently under development. Features and UI are subject to change.

ðŸ”§ What It Does
- Fetches all videos from your Watch Later playlist and stores them locally for quick access
- Randomly picks 5 videos to help you start watching
- Includes simple management tools like removing videos you donâ€™t want to watch
- Helps reduce decision fatigue and keeps your playlist manageable

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

I would like to publish this in Chrome Web Store. But for now, you can:

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder
