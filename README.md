# 🎲 Watch Later Roulette

**Drowning in your Watch Later playlist? Spin the wheel and let fate decide!**  

Watch Later Roulette is a simple browser extension that helps you finally start watching your ever-growing Watch Later playlist — one random video at a time.

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This project is currently under development. Features and UI are subject to change.

🔧 What It Does
- Fetches video from your Watch Later playlist (TODO: store them locally for quick access)
- Randomly picks 5 videos to help you start watching
- Includes simple management tools like removing videos you don’t want to watch
- Helps reduce decision fatigue and keeps your playlist manageable

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **No dark mode** — beware of potential retina damage (just kidding... kind of)  
- **Only the first 100 videos** can be fetched from your Watch Later playlist  
    - Want more randomness? Scroll to the bottom of the playlist first to load more videos, then hit **Refresh**  
- **Some main functions are still under development**, so don’t be surprised if things occasionally break  

## 📦 Installation

I would like to publish this in Chrome Web Store. But for now, you can:

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode**
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder
